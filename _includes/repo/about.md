## Let's raise the visibility of documentation in Ruby!

This page is for <code>{{ page.repo.name | replace: '_', '\_' }}</code> and is part of a project called "Inch Pages", showing documentation measurements provided by [Inch](http://trivelop.de/inch).
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Inch Pages</span> also provides a badge: <img src="/github/{{ page.repo.name }}.png">
<small>(<a href="https://github.com/rrrene/inch-pages/commit/51555d50d21e234fa240fc9920cf7c27310ff542">not counting</a> low priority objects)</small>


### Can I have my own badges?

<a href="/participate?repo={{ page.repo.name | replace: '_', '\_' | url_escape }}">Sure!</a>


### What is the goal of this?

I really think that posting badges for documentation in READMEs will benefit you (because <strong>people can see that your project is well documented</strong>) and our community in general by improving the visibility of documentation.


Let's start a discussion, let's raise the visibility of documentation, let's talk.
